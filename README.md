# Square-Noise---Generative-Media-Coiding-Course

I am interested in creating 3D shade illusions by using only flat objects. I want that the gradient is not created by the color but by some increasing changes in the pattern. In this example the ilussion of a hole is achieved by the gradient of scaling the rectangles by a smooth noise to the ones that are controlled by a chaotic noise.
